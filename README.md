# melange-fragmentation-theory
Code for application of fragmentation theory equations to iceberg size distributions extracted from very high-resolution digital elevation models of near-terminus ice melange.
The only two files that you need to run, in order, to execute the code are 1_generate_size_distrib.m (a Matlab wrapper code that will call all necessary Matlab functions in this repository) and 2_manually_adjust_fits.ipynb. The Python notebook should be run with Jupyter so that the user can use sliders to manually adjust the automated fits produced with the Matlab codes so that they are tuned to match the larger iceberg size classes in each distribution. Because branching iceberg fragmentation results in a power-law distribution of icebergs that is subject to secondary modification in the ocean, namely submarine melting of icebergs that will preferentially influence smaller icebergs with larger surface area:volume ratios, the automated fits will poorly model the size distributions when and where secondary processes are important. 

This code was developed jointly by Ellyn Enderlin, Jukes Liu, and Michal Kopera at Boise State University. Please contact ellynenderlin@boisestate.edu or post a issue or discussion on Github if you encounter problems using any codes in this repository.
